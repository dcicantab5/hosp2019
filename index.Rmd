***Workload dictates amount of manpower.***

Varying manpower resources across hospitals.
<br> Varying workload across hospitals.
<br>
<br> Because the number of admissions varies across hospitals, the workload is standardised to per 1000 admissions.
<br>
<br> **Standardised Workload = Number of specialists per 1000 admissions.**
<br>
<br> $${Standardised\;Workload = {Number\;of\; specialists} \div \left( \displaystyle \frac{Admissions}{1000}\right)}$$
<br>
<br> *e.g. HKL has 76 specialists handling General Medicine workload, for the given number of admissions in HKL (37067), it has 2.1 specialists handling every 1000 admissions.*

<br>

Limitations: fair distribution requires consideration and information on outpatient, daycare, and referral workload and fulfilling demands for up-to-date treatment provided by a subspecialty.
